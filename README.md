# MAGBANK - the only bank with imagination!

The initial proposal of this project was make a preview of a bank, using the REACT technology, and extract many resources that this library can possibilite, like styled components and redirect routes.

For styles, I used SASS pre-processor and some utilitary classes provided by bootstrap.

For the routes, I used the React Router Dom.

For a fake authentication, I used some properties provided by own React, just to simulate a real bank record.


## How you can run the application:

### `npm run start`

Run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
